# HTTP Status Codes Breakdown

Servers aren’t just machines , they’re the ultimate introverts. They talk in numbers and expect you to figure it out. Let’s crack their secret language.

---

## 1xx: "Hang Tight, We’re Getting There"
These are like typing indicators: "Processing your request, but not ready yet."

- **100 Continue**: "Your headers look good. Send the rest (the body)."
- **101 Switching Protocols**: "Switching from HTTP to something else, like WebSockets. Just don’t break anything."
- **102 Processing (WebDAV)**: "I’m working on it, promise. But it’s complicated, so give me a minute."

## 2xx: "Success! Nailed It!"
These codes mean the server got your request and handled it like a boss.

- **200 OK**: "Here’s what you asked for. No drama, just results."
- **201 Created**: "Made something new just for you. Check the `Location` header for its URL."
- **202 Accepted**: "I’ve got your request, but I’m working on it. Chill for now."
- **203 Non-Authoritative Information**: "I got this info from someone else. Take it or leave it."
- **204 No Content**: "Request handled, but there’s no content to send back. Perfect for DELETE actions."
- **205 Reset Content**: "Done! Now reset that form or UI. It’s safe."
- **206 Partial Content**: "Here’s part of the file you wanted. Ask for the rest if you need it."

## 3xx: "Hey, Go Over There"
These codes mean the server is redirecting you somewhere else. Trust the process.

- **300 Multiple Choices**: "Too many options. You decide."
- **301 Moved Permanently**: "This resource has a new forever home. Update your bookmarks."
- **302 Found**: "Temporary detour. Keep using the old address for now."
- **303 See Other**: "Go to this other URL with a GET request."
- **304 Not Modified**: "Nothing’s changed. Use your cached version and save bandwidth."
- **307 Temporary Redirect**: "Same as **302**, but stricter about keeping the method (e.g., POST stays POST)."
- **308 Permanent Redirect**: "Like **301**, but it insists on keeping the request method intact."

---

## 4xx: "You Messed Up, Not Me"
These codes are the server saying, "Check yourself before you wreck yourself."

- **400 Bad Request**: "Your request is nonsense. Double-check your syntax or data."
- **401 Unauthorized**: "No credentials? No access. Log in first."
- **403 Forbidden**: "Credentials or not, you’re not allowed here."
- **404 Not Found**: "Whatever you’re looking for? Not here. Maybe never was."
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: "You used the wrong tool (like POST instead of GET). Try again."
- **408 Request Timeout**: "Took too long. I’ve got better things to do."
- **429 Too Many Requests**: "Whoa, slow down! You’re overloading me."

---

## 5xx: "Server’s Having a Meltdown"
The server’s owning up: "Yeah, this one’s on me."

- **500 Internal Server Error**: "Something broke on my end. Sorry!"
- **501 Not Implemented**: "That feature you asked for? I don’t even have it."
- **502 Bad Gateway**: "I got a bad response from another server. Not my fault, blame them."
- **503 Service Unavailable**: "I’m either down, busy, or just napping. Try later."
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: "The upstream server didn’t respond in time. Not much I can do."

## Nerdy Nuggets (Why You Should Care)
1. **Caching with 304**: If the resource hasn’t changed, the server says, "Use your cache." Saves everyone time.
2. **Permanent vs. Temporary Redirects**:  
   - **301/308**: Forever moves—update your links.  
   - **302/307**: Short-term detours—no need to change anything long-term.
3. **Error Debugging**:  
   - **4xx**: You messed up. Check the request URL, headers, or data.  
   - **5xx**: Server messed up. Check logs or scream into the void.

## TL;DR for the Overwhelmed
- **1xx**: Chill, it’s just starting.
- **2xx**: All good=>success.
- **3xx**: Redirect, follow the breadcrumbs.
- **4xx**: You screwed up. Fix it.
- **5xx**: Server’s having a bad day.

With this cheat sheet, you can handle HTTP codes like a pro , or at least fake it until u do.
